condecht
========

condecht is a software to deploy and remove configfiles and their depending packages. You can save all your configfiles of all hosts in one central place and distinguish all files the same time time. With a main database of 
With condecht you can store configurations of all your hosts in one (git/svn/bzr/whatever)-repository 
With a versioning system you get a synchronized config-file base, what you can use on every system.

Dependencies
------------

You have to install these perl-module:
* Config::IniFiles

Install it with `sudo cpan -i "Config::IniFiles"`

There modules Getopt::Long and Pod::Usage should be included in a standard perl installation. If not install them with `sudo cpan -i Getopt::Long Pod::Usage`.

Main Files
----------
There are 3 Main Files:
* The condecht.pl Executable or the condecht command
* The /etc/condecht Configuration-File for condecht
* The packages.conf package-conf-file located at the root of your repo

condecht tree-structure
-----------------------
**ROOT**
* the executable:
  * condecht (link to condecht.pl)
  * condecht.pl
* the condecht-config
  * $condechthost/
   * $package/
    * config-files for $package

### The Tree
~ = CondechtRoot (defined in /etc/condecht)

* /etc/condecht
* ~/condecht.pl
* ~/condecht (link to condecht.pl)
* ~/packages.conf
* ~/$host/
* ~/$host/$package/
* ~/$host/$package/$config-file1

* ~/$host/$package/$config-fileX

USAGE
-----
condecht [OPTIONs] COMMAND $package

COMMANDs:
You have to combine at least two of those four options together
  * --pi @packages | Install @packages & config
  * --pr @packages | Remove @packages & config
  * --ci @packages | install config of @packages
  * --cr @packages | remove config of @packages

  * -Sc || -Ss | These 2 Flags are used to update the Repository. In use-case: If you update the destination config-file, you just need to execute "condecht --Ss" (or something similar) and not to copy the file manually into your repository. For now, the script just dies with this option.
  * --lp | list the packages, configured in your packages.conf

OPTIONs:
  * -c --config $file | take $file as alternative config-file for condecht
  *    --check        | check the config-file of condecht for errors (missing files, etc)
  *    --host $host   | Pretend to be on $host
  * -h --help         | print help and exit
