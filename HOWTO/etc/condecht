#Mind it: this file has to be placed at the end
#to the directory /etc with the name condecht

# in this file define at fist the "main" section
[main]

# at first give your host a unique hostname for condecht
# name it like you want. it is not necessary to name it like your computer
# dont use "all" as hostname
host = bebe-arch-lap

# lets define a distribution too
# it will be very useful, if you work with one repository 
# at 10 different machines with a few distributions
# you don't have to retype all packages into your packages.conf for every host,
# just for every distribution you use
dist = arch

# it is the directory path, where your repository
# with your packages.conf-file is stored
path = /root/condecht

# if you activate this files get backed up into your
# repository, if you remove them from the filesystem
# if you accidentally remove some configs with condecht, you'll have backup
backup = true

# this is the command with what the system-packages get installed
# if you use Debian or similar, there should stand:
#
# pkgINS = sudo apt-get install
# pkgREM = sudo apt-get remove
#
# this below is for arch-linux
pkgINS = sudo pacman -S
pkgREM = sudo pacman -R

# if you've got some user-specific configs which are not for your system,
# your home-dir, fileowner, and filegroup are depending on the name of this user.
# So in your packages.conf you use such replacers like $user$, $home$ and $group$
# to handle such different usernames. below you can define, with what these will
# get replaced
user = bebe
group = bebe
home = /home/bebe

# similar to the umask setup. But here deferperm 755 is the same as permission 755
# so it is inverted
